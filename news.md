- 9-21~22-2019 Caitlin and I will be co-teaching a workshop with [Stefana Parascho](https://soa.princeton.edu/content/stefana-parascho) from Princeton on [Fabrication-informed Design of Robotically Assembled Structures](https://design-modelling-symposium.de/theworkshops/workshops/) at this year's Design Modeling Symposium (DMS) at Berlin.

- 6-19 ~ 8-31-2019 I'll be a guest researcher at [Gramazio & Kohler research group](http://gramaziokohler.arch.ethz.ch/) at ETH-Zurich this summer, working on integrating our sequence and motion planning tool [Choreo](https://github.com/yijiangh/choreo) to the [compas](https://compas-dev.github.io/) framework.

- 4-28-2019 I gave a talk on *Sequence and motion planning for robotic spatial extrusion* at Boston University's [Artificial Intelligence Research Seminar](https://www.bu.edu/hic/air/seminars/), invited by [Prof. Emily Whiting](http://cs-people.bu.edu/whiting/).

- 2-28-2019 I'll be presenting a poster titled "Automated Planning for Robotic Spatial 3D Printing" on the [launch celebration for the MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing](https://helloworld.mit.edu/agendas/)(7-9pm). Come and say hi if you are around! 

- 1-14~15-2019 I'm attending the [AMS Short Course Sum of Squares: *Theory and Application*](http://www.ams.org/meetings/short-courses/short-course-general/), Baltimore, MD. Please drop by and say hi if you are around!

- 12-8-2019 New journal paper out with [Caelan Garrett](http://web.mit.edu/caelan/www/) and [Caitlin Mueller](http://digitalstructures.mit.edu/) detailing the algorithms and implementations of the extrusion planning framework [choreo](https://github.com/yijiangh/choreo)! The paper is titled [Automated sequence and motion planning for robotic spatial extrusion of 3D trusses](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41693-018-0012-z).

- 9-14-2018 I'm presenting at [RobArch 2018 conference](http://www.robarch2018.org/schedule/) at ETH Zurich!
