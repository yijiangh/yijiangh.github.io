I'm a postdoc at ETH Zurich's [Computational Robotics Lab](http://crl.ethz.ch/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Stelian Coros](http://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html).
My research objective is to develop **computational planning methods that coordinate robots, humans, and resources to enable the efficient construction of sustainable structural solutions**.
<!-- I do research at the intersection between architectural design, computing, and robotic fabrication.
My work centers on **designing construction with computation**: the modeling and automated planning of the construction process so that various aspects of it can be precisely controlled, simulated, and encoded quantitatively. 
This means not only that the construction becomes flexible to upstream design changes, but the architectural design process can be informed by the construction logic. 
As a part of this vision, I am interested in enabling materially efficient design solutions with the use of construction robotics. -->

I earned my Ph.D. degree in 2022 from MIT's Building Technology Program of the Department of Architecture.
My advisor was [Prof. Caitlin Mueller](http://digitalstructures.mit.edu/page/about#mueller), and I enjoyed being a part of her [Digital Structures research group](http://digitalstructures.mit.edu/).
Previously, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Applied Math at the [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
I was fortunate to have received [MIT Presidential Fellowship](https://web.mit.edu/provost/presfellow/) twice (2016, 2018) and I am currently supported by [ETH Zurich Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://ethz.ch/en/research/research-promotion/eth-fellowships.html).

<!-- I am a researcher in **digital design and fabrication**. -->
<!-- Most of my work builds rigorous algorithmic tools to investigate the new possibilities that emerge from the reciprocal interaction between design and computing.  -->

My [Ph.D. thesis](https://web.mit.edu/yijiangh/www/papers/huang_2022_dissertation.pdf) develops *task and motion planning algorithms* that offload tedious programming work from designers and advance the capability of robotic assembly systems. 
I have formed invaluable research collaborations with experts across MIT, Princeton, and ETH Zurich to test my algorithms on real robot fabrication systems in various physical scales, including [spatial printing of trusses](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02360.pdf), [assembly of bar systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11438.pdf), [Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) of metal connections](https://gramaziokohler.arch.ethz.ch/web/e/forschung/361.html), and the assembly of three two-story-high [timber structures with integral joints](https://gramaziokohler.arch.ethz.ch/web/e/forschung/370.html).

<br />

In addition, I developed optimal matching algorithms to support circularity-driven structural design workflow that utilizes traditionally undervalued, discarded natural resources like [tree branches](https://web.mit.edu/yijiangh/www/papers/AAG2020_Structural_Upcycling.pdf) and [reclaimed building elements](https://web.mit.edu/yijiangh/www/papers/circular_dome_2021.pdf).
One of these upcycling projects was featured on [Dezeen](https://www.dezeen.com/2022/05/05/tree-forks-mit-digital-structures-architecture/).

<!-- <br />

My long-term research vision centers around **fabrication-enabled sustainability** - achieving sustainable outcomes through integrating interactive computational design environments with advanced robotic fabrication systems.
Achieving this vision requires technological innovation in both robot planning and design methodology:

1. Planning and control for **collaborative, on-site** robotic manufacturing
2. How can we build **general-purpose disassembly robots**? (flexible and adaptable, compared to [Apple's Daisy robot](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/04/apple-adds-earth-day-donations-to-trade-in-and-recycling-program/) that requires a lot of manual programming)
3. How can we systematically **design geometries for robotic dis- and re-assembly** of reused material? -->

Outside of research, I enjoy reading and pondering about the intertwined relationship between media, culture, and technology (among my favorites: [Lawrence Li](https://mastodon.social/@lawrencelry)'s [一天世界](https://blog.yitianshijie.net/), [Ted Gioia](https://www.honest-broker.com/), and [Neil Postman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Postman)).
I like listening to and [collecting](https://www.instagram.com/swingingmori/) Japanese jazz ([和ジャズ](https://youtu.be/cFUGeUncjtA?si=DWeIoVOTep1B4v_E)) records. 
I played football with BKP FC (Boston) and [Vevey Sports-III](https://veveysports.ch/) (Switzerland) and I support Liverpool FC.
